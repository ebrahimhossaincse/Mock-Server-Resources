## Introduction

The Mock-Server-Resources project is designed to help developers test and develop functionalities without the need for a full backend implementation. It provides a set of datasets and configurations that simulate various operations such as managing products, orders, customers, and more.

## Features

- Mock API endpoints for various operations.
- Easy to set up and use for development and testing purposes.
- Customizable data to simulate various scenarios.
- Lightweight and fast, with no dependencies on a real database.

## Installation

To set up the Mock-Server-Resources, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ebrahimhossaincse/Mock-Server-Resources.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Mock-Server-Resources/anysample folder
    ```
3. Install `json-server` globally if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    npm install -g json-server
    ```

## Usage
